SOME IDEAS about xdb format:

Result of checking shows that even just putted to mods folder xdb-file processes by engine, and its textures or
thm's will overlapp default game settings, what allows for example to fix too blue colors by smallsky's in r2,
and this is way to increase quality of second render with bad default soc-weather. Also you can connect to servers after
that without any problems, where peoples plays without that fixes.

Its possible to create xdb-file with level for which textures will automaticly load from another xdb-file.

Also possible of creating xdb-file without level at all and only with textures. And simultaneously create rather small
xdb-archives of levels without textures or their minium, without any necessity of dublicate already existed textures.
During creating such archive you should be carefull, because even one spare thm with wrong settings if it conflicts
by name with any existed textures in SOC, it will overlap their settings so result to bugs on soc-levels.
As side-effect it can be long game running, because engine needs time anyway to reread all additional xdb with levels 
and textures.

About *.thm files: in them stored settings for textures something like connection with details, bumps and scaling of details,
like for terrains. Same settings stored in textures.ltx. If file is written in textures.ltx, but simultaneously have
own thm, then settings of thm will have priority.

Its forbidden to create xdb-file with textures from subfolder textures\act. It this happens xdb-file will be broken. I mean
by having this file in folder mods you can't connect to any standart server. But if there is already ready level, which
wana missing SOC textures from this folder, its possible to create for example not folder textures\act, but
textures\azt. And after by HEX-editor in file level replace all calls to folder act to azt.

You can also create one xdb-file from start with many levels, but advantages of this doubtful because if y need fixing that
you will need to rebuild all pack.

Even singleplayer, if game asks for textures, loads them from xdb, if it finds them. Self *.xdb0 files as usual are in mods folder.

Name of xdb-file is not important, essential only extension type xdb0.

How CORRECT TO PACK mp-map to xdb (instruction ONLY for SOC):

As example we will use map red_forest - lets it's be such name for ready level.

We are taking bardak converter.

In folder with converter y create file pack-xdb.bat with this inside:

converter -pack project -xdb -out project.xdb0
pause

In folder with converter create subfolder project. And inside it will be such folders and files:

config\text\map_desc\red_forest.ltx

levels\red_forest\level.ltx + files of level

textures\intro\intro_map_pic_red_forest.dds (+thm in some case) - picture to show in creation server menu
textures\intro\intro_red_forest.dds (+thm-ка на всяк. случай) - picture of loading level process
textures\map\map_red_forest.dds (+thm-ка на всяк. случай) - minimap (plan of area) of level


Content of red_forest.ltx:

[map_info]
players = 8-32
modes = "st_deathmatch, st_team_deathmatch, st_artefacthunt"
short_desc = "Here should be short description"
large_desc = "Here should be full description"


Content of level.ltx:

[map_usage]
ver=1.0
deathmatch
teamdeathmatch
artefacthunt

[red_forest]
bound_rect = -285.000000,-485.000000,375.000000,175.000000
global_rect = 198.0, 1028.0, 380.0, 1210.000000
texture = map\map_red_forest

[deathmatch_game_anomaly_sets]
permanent = mp_rail_rad1,mp_rail_rad2,mp_rail_rad3, mp_railroad_zone_mine_gravitational_strong, mp_railroad_zone_mine_acidic_strong

set0= mp_railroad_zone_mine_gravitational_strong_0000,mp_railroad_zone_mine_gravitational_strong_0001,mp_rail_gz2

set2= mp_railroad_zone_mine_gravitational_strong_0000,mp_railroad_zone_mine_electric_strong

[teamdeathmatch_game_anomaly_sets]
permanent = mp_rail_rad1, mp_rail_rad2, mp_rail_rad3,mp_railroad_zone_mine_gravitational_strong, mp_railroad_zone_mine_acidic_strong

[artefacthunt_game_anomaly_sets]

set2= mp_railroad_zone_mine_gravitational_strong_0000,mp_railroad_zone_mine_electric_strong

Run pack-xdb.bat. Rename obtained project.xdb0 as we wana and put it to game into folder mods and first step is try 
to connect to several internet-servers with standart maps. If not working, then we packed something additional. 
Only textures (exept act) can be packed, level itself and that config with map description.
